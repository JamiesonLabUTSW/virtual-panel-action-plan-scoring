  "rationale": "The background is extremely minimal and purely compliance-focused, with no discussion of prior efforts, barriers, or educational need beyond meeting ACGME requirements. While the objective has clear metrics (baseline and targets for number of sessions and attendance), the scope is limited to scheduling and tracking rather than defining educational content, learning objectives, or how simulation will improve resident competence. The action steps are very basic administrative tasks (reserve rooms, send invites, enter into MedHub) and omit key elements such as case selection, faculty involvement, pre-/post-assessment, or how low attendance will be addressed. This is a narrowly framed, logistical plan that meets minimal expectations for metrics but is otherwise underdeveloped.",
