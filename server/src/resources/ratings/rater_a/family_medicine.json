  "rationale": "Background and need are clearly described with specific examples of resident discomfort and curricular gaps, though no baseline comfort data or mapping of current behavioral health content is provided. The objective has a reasonable timeline and an implied metric (resident-reported comfort and session count), but targets are vague (\"majority\" and \"several sessions\" without numeric thresholds or baseline). Steps are straightforward and feasible, but mostly limited to adding sessions and inviting faculty; there is no detail on instructional design, integration with clinic, or how content will be standardized and assessed beyond self-reported comfort. Overall this meets minimal expectations but could be strengthened with clearer quantitative goals and more robust educational planning.",
