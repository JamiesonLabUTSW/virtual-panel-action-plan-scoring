  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-constructed item with clear linkage from a rich background dataset (multi-year ACGME survey trends, internal surveys, ABSITE subscores, and detailed case log benchmarks) to a focused problem in operative autonomy and progressive responsibility. The objective is specific, time-bound, and includes explicit quantitative targets across multiple domains, and the measurements section further clarifies baselines and goals, including thoughtful process metrics. The steps are detailed, phased, and assign responsibility and timelines, and the iterative and summative evaluation plans demonstrate a mature approach to monitoring implementation and outcomes. Minor opportunities for enhancement would be to more explicitly address how competing clinical productivity pressures will be managed operationally, but this is still clearly in the top tier of action plans.",
