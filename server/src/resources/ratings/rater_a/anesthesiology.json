  "program": "anesthesiology",
  "rationale": "The background briefly acknowledges prior efforts and loss of momentum but does not describe what was tried, why it failed, or how the approach will be modified, so the carry-over explanation is thin. The objective is very general and not clearly tied to specific wellness outcomes, and the metric of 'regular meetings' is vague without a defined frequency or attendance expectation. Steps are minimal and purely administrative (re-form committee, resume meetings) with no detail on committee structure, agenda, responsibilities, or how feedback from surveys will be translated into interventions. Overall, this is an underdeveloped plan that does not provide confidence it will meaningfully address resident burnout.",
