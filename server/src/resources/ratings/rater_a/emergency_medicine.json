  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-structured item with clear linkage from rich baseline data (ACGME survey trends, internal survey, CCC notes, and safety events) to the stated need for a standardized supervision and entrustment framework. The objectives include explicit, quantifiable metrics with baseline and targets across multiple domains, and the scope is appropriately complex, spanning tools, culture change, CCC processes, and patient safety. The action steps are detailed, time-bound, and aligned with the evaluation and iterative/summative plans, which include thoughtful monitoring of both educational and safety outcomes as well as documentation burden. Minor gaps (e.g., no explicit contingency plan if targets are not met) do not materially detract from the overall quality, which clearly exceeds minimal expectations.",
