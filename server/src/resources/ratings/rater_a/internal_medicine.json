  "rationale": "The background is reasonably detailed and clearly explains the perceived problem, though it lacks any concrete baseline data or prior attempts to address clinic volume or continuity. The objectives and measurements are directionally appropriate but remain vague: there is no defined numeric target for patient volume, no recorded baseline survey value, and the key term \"adequate\" is left undefined, which weakens the metrics dimension. The scope and steps are straightforward and logically sequenced, but they are relatively modest and focus mostly on template tweaks and informal feedback without a more robust plan for defining, tracking, and managing resident panels or chronic disease exposure. Overall, this meets minimal expectations but would benefit from clearer quantitative targets, a more explicit panel management strategy, and better linkage between the perceived problem and the planned interventions.",
