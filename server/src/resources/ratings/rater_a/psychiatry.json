  "rationale": "The background provides a clear, data-based rationale referencing the 2024 ACGME survey and resident comments, which is adequate for a new item. The objective is conceptually appropriate but very broad and lacks a clearly defined target for improvement in satisfaction or a timeline for completion. The measurement section identifies a relevant metric and baseline but only states “improvement,” which is weak for goal-setting, and the evaluation plan is limited to a single annual survey plus one informal check-in. The action steps are sparse and high-level (review topics, solicit volunteers) without details on how the curriculum will be redesigned, how resident input will be systematically incorporated, or how implementation and participation will be monitored, so the overall plan is underdeveloped.",
