  "program": "pediatrics",
  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-constructed item with clear baseline data, comparison to national benchmarks, and a compelling rationale that ties survey data, qualitative feedback, and institutional resources together. The objectives include explicit metrics, baselines, and time-bound targets across multiple domains (projects, products, mentorship perception, ACGME survey), and the scope is appropriately multi-dimensional. The steps and iterative/summative evaluations are detailed, logically sequenced, and clearly linked to the stated objectives, with interim targets and mechanisms for course correction. Minor areas that could be strengthened include clarifying accountability for ensuring scholarly quality (beyond quantity) and specifying how competing clinical demands will be managed if protected time targets are not met, but these do not substantially detract from the overall quality.",
