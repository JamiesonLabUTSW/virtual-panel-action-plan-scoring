  "rationale": "The background is relatively solid for a new item, with a clear description of the perceived gap, some reference to APE discussion, and a reasonable rationale for strengthening behavioral health didactics; however, it remains largely anecdotal and lacks any real baseline data or specificity about the current curriculum. The objective has an implied metric (resident comfort) and a basic plan to add sessions, but the success metric is vague (\"majority\" comfortable, no numeric target or baseline) and the didactic-session metric is particularly weak (\"several\" sessions, exact number TBD), which makes this hard to evaluate meaningfully. Steps are linear and feasible but quite superficial: there is no detail on session format, integration with clinic, assessment of knowledge/skills, or how they will ensure behavioral health clinician involvement beyond simply \"reaching out.\" Overall, this meets minimal expectations but is not well developed for a robust curricular improvement effort.",
