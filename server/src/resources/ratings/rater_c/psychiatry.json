  "program": "psychiatry",
  "rationale": "The background provides a concrete data point and a brief rationale, which is adequate but not particularly detailed. The objective is appropriately broad but remains high-level without specifying what a revamped curriculum will concretely include or how alignment with milestones will be operationalized. The metric is weakly specified as simply \"improvement\" from 38%, with no explicit target, and the plan relies almost entirely on the ACGME survey plus a single informal check-in, which is insufficient for meaningful iterative evaluation. Action steps are very sparse (review topics and solicit volunteers), omit timelines for implementation, needs assessment, resident involvement, piloting, or any structured feedback mechanism, and the team is limited to the PD alone, suggesting an underdeveloped and incomplete plan.",
