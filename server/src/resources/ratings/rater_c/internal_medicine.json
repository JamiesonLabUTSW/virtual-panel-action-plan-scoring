  "rationale": "The background and rationale are reasonably clear and specific, with appropriate stakeholder input and a plausible description of the problem, but there is no discussion of prior efforts or how this builds on them. Metrics are only partially developed: the survey item is vague with no documented baseline, and the plan to define “adequate” patient volume after initial review leaves the primary quantitative target undefined for most of the cycle. The scope and steps are relatively simple and mostly process-focused (template tweaks, a noon conference, scheduler reminders, a check-in) without a more robust plan for systematic panel management, longitudinal tracking, or analysis of whether changes actually improve chronic disease continuity. Overall, this meets minimal expectations but lacks specificity around targets, deeper panel management strategies, and a more detailed evaluation plan beyond year-over-year satisfaction comparison.",
