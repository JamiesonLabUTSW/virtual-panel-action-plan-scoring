  "rationale": "This is a very strong, unusually thorough action item with clear linkage from a well-documented problem (including baseline data and national benchmarks) to specific, measurable objectives. Metrics are explicit, include baselines and time-bound targets, and span products, processes, and perceptions. The scope and steps are multi-dimensional (curriculum, mentorship infrastructure, protected time, tracking systems, funding, and culture/visibility), with clear timelines, responsible parties, and both iterative and summative evaluation plans that are tightly aligned with the objectives. The only minor limitation is that feasibility risks (e.g., biostatistics bandwidth, ensuring faculty mentor quality) are not fully anticipated, but this is still well beyond minimal expectations on every rubric dimension.",
