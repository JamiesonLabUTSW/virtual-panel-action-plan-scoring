  "rationale": "This is an unusually strong, well-constructed item. The background is data-rich, clearly articulates the problem using multiple sources (ACGME, internal surveys, ABSITE subscores, case logs, qualitative feedback), and ties them together into a coherent rationale for change. The objectives include explicit, time-bound metrics with clear baselines and ambitious but plausible targets across perception, volume, and knowledge domains, plus process metrics. Steps are detailed, sequenced, and involve appropriate stakeholders, with clear attention to feasibility, piloting, and scale-up, and the iterative and summative evaluation plans are robust and aligned with the stated outcomes. The only minor limitation is that some timelines are long and could benefit from earlier low-stakes pilots, but this does not materially detract from the overall quality.",
