  "rationale": "This is essentially an administrative scheduling/compliance task, not a meaningful educational improvement initiative. The background is minimal and does not describe any prior efforts, barriers, or educational rationale beyond “ACGME requires it,” and there is no discussion of simulation content, objectives, or how this will enhance resident competence. While the metrics are explicit (number of sessions and attendance rates) and the steps are clear, they are very narrow—focused only on room booking, calendar invites, and MedHub entries, with no plan to evaluate educational quality, resident feedback, or outcomes beyond attendance. Overall, it meets basic structural expectations but is shallow in scope and educational impact.",
