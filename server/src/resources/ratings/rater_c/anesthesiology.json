  "program": "anesthesiology",
  "rationale": "This is a very thin, largely administrative plan that focuses on simply reconstituting a committee and holding meetings, with almost no detail on what the committee will actually do to impact wellness. The background is minimal and does not explain why the committee failed to meet, what was learned from that failure, or how the approach will be modified, and the vague reference to baseline data is not elaborated. The metric of \"regular meetings\" is poorly defined and does not assess resident wellness outcomes, and the team is inappropriately limited to the PD with no clear inclusion of residents or other stakeholders in ownership of the process. Steps are superficial (re-form committee, resume meetings) with no structure, agenda, interventions, or concrete assessment plan beyond a generic end-of-year survey review.",
