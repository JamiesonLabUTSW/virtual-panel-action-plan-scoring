  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-constructed item with clear linkage among background data, objectives, metrics, and planned steps. The background is detailed, uses multiple data sources (ACGME survey, internal survey, CCC data, safety events), and clearly explains why a standardized supervision/entrustment framework is needed. The objectives include explicit, quantifiable targets with baselines, and the scope is multi-dimensional (resident experience, faculty behavior, CCC function, and patient safety). Steps are specific, time-bound, assign responsibility, and incorporate both iterative and summative evaluation, though they could be slightly strengthened by more explicit contingency planning if targets are not met or if documentation burden proves excessive. Overall, this clearly exceeds minimal expectations but is not quite at a \"5\" level of exhaustive detail and long-term sustainability planning.",
