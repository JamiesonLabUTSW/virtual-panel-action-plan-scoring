  "rationale": "Rounding up to a 4. The background is brief but clearly tied to an ACGME requirement, and the objective is narrow but appropriate for a compliance-focused item. Metrics are explicit with baseline and targets, and the steps are concrete, feasible, and linked to clear evaluation mechanisms via MedHub. This is essentially an administrative scheduling/tracking task with limited educational depth, but for what it aims to do, it is well specified and structured.",
