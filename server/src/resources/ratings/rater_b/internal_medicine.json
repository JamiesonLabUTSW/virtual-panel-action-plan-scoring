  "rationale": "Background and rationale are clear and appropriately detailed, with a good description of resident concerns, EHR changes, and the lack of current standards for volume/panel tracking. The objectives and measurements are mostly reasonable but stay somewhat vague on key metrics (no baseline yet, no concrete numerical target for patient volume or continuity, and no plan to quantify panel management beyond perception). Steps are logical, feasible, and aligned with the goal, but remain modest in scope and do not fully address how resident panel size/continuity will be systematically defined and tracked over time. Overall this meets expectations and is likely to be achievable, but could be strengthened with explicit numeric targets and clearer operationalization of “adequate” volume and continuity.",
