  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-constructed item with excellent background data (including trends, comparison to national means, internal survey, CCC data, and safety events) and a clear rationale linking supervision, feedback, entrustment, and patient safety. The objectives include explicit metrics with baselines and targets across multiple domains, and the scope is multi-dimensional (observation frequency, survey climate, CCC data, safety events) with a defined timeline. Steps are detailed, role-assigned, and logically sequenced, with thoughtful iterative and summative evaluation plans that use multiple data sources and feedback loops. I’m rounding to a 5 given how comprehensive and integrated the plan is, though there could be slightly more detail on how they will ensure faculty compliance beyond reminders/coaching.",
  "score": 5
