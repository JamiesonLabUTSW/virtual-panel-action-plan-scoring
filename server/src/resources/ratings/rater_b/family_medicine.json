  "rationale": "Background and need are clearly described with a reasonable rationale, though there is no discussion of prior attempts or why current content is insufficient beyond being scattered. The objective has an explicit, resident-reported comfort metric and a count of didactic sessions, but lacks a defined baseline and numeric target for the number of sessions. Steps are straightforward and feasible, with some iterative and summative evaluation built in, but they are relatively simple (focused mainly on adding lectures) and do not address how teaching quality or actual clinical performance will be assessed. Overall this meets expectations and is likely achievable, but could be strengthened with clearer targets and a more robust educational strategy beyond increasing session count.",
