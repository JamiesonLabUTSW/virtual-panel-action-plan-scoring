  "rationale": "The background is concise with a clear data point and resident comments that justify the need, but as a new item it could better explain what has already been tried locally, if anything. The objective is appropriately broad and aligned with the identified problem, yet the metric is weakly specified (“improvement”) without a concrete target or additional measures (e.g., attendance, qualitative feedback). Action steps are very limited and high-level, with no timeline beyond “Fall 2025” and “ongoing,” no description of how the curriculum will actually be redesigned, piloted, or assessed, and no mechanism to ensure resident input beyond informal check-ins. Overall this meets minimal expectations but lacks detail in both metrics and steps for a comprehensive revamp.",
