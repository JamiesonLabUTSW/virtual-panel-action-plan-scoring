  "rationale": "The background provides a clear, if brief, explanation of prior efforts and why this is being carried over, but does not elaborate on what was learned from last year’s failure to sustain the committee. The objective is extremely simple and the metric of “regular meetings” is vague, with no defined frequency or direct link to wellness outcomes beyond counting meetings. Steps are minimal and lack detail on committee structure, agenda, or how resident input will be translated into concrete wellness initiatives. Overall this meets only minimal expectations and feels more like an administrative checkbox than a robust wellness plan.",
