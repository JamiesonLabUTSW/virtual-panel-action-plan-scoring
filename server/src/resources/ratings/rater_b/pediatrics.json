  "rationale": "This is a very strong, well-constructed item with an excellent background that uses concrete baseline data, institutional goals, and national benchmarks, clearly explaining the need and prior limitations. The objectives include explicit, time-bound metrics with clear targets for multiple domains (projects, products, mentorship perceptions, ACGME scores), and the scope is appropriately multi-dimensional (curriculum, mentorship, infrastructure, protected time, culture). The steps are detailed, phased, and feasible, with clear ownership and timelines, and the iterative and summative evaluation plans tie directly back to the stated objectives with interim targets. Minor room for improvement would be more explicit contingency planning if protected time or biostat support cannot be fully realized, but overall this clearly exceeds minimal expectations.",
