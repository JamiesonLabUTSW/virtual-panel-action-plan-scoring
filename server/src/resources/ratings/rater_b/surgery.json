  "program": "surgery",
  "rationale": "Exceptionally strong and well-structured item with clear rationale grounded in multiple data sources (ACGME survey, internal surveys, ABSITE subscores, case logs, and qualitative feedback). The objectives include explicit, time-bound metrics with clear baselines and ambitious but plausible targets, plus thoughtful process measures. Steps are detailed, logically sequenced, and clearly tied to the stated outcomes, with robust iterative and summative evaluation plans that include both quantitative and qualitative assessment. This is a multi-dimensional, comprehensive curriculum intervention that goes well beyond minimal expectations; only minor potential limitation is the ambitious scope and timeline, but overall it warrants a high score.",
