~~~Specific Content Areas:~~~
Didactic Curriculum – Outpatient Behavioral Health

~~~Background:~~~
Residents have expressed in informal discussions that they sometimes feel unsure about managing common behavioral health conditions in the outpatient continuity clinic (e.g., depression, anxiety, ADHD). The current didactic schedule includes some behavioral health topics, but they are spread out and not always aligned with clinic experiences. In the most recent APE discussion, faculty noted variable comfort among residents in initiating and adjusting psychotropic medications. There is not a clearly defined behavioral health series within our existing didactic structure, and we have had limited involvement from our embedded behavioral health providers in resident teaching. The program plans to add more structured behavioral health teaching to the didactic curriculum.

~~~Objective:~~~
By June 30, 2026, incorporate a more consistent outpatient behavioral health component into the residency didactic schedule so that residents have regular exposure to key topics such as depression, anxiety, and ADHD. The goal is for residents to report improved comfort with outpatient behavioral health management on an end-of-year survey.

~~~Data or Innovation:~~~
We have limited informal data from resident comments and APE discussions, but no formal baseline survey or tracking of behavioral health didactic content to date.

~~~Measurement(s)- Source, Current Value, Expected Value:~~~
- Resident Perceived Comfort with Outpatient Behavioral Health
  - Source: Program-created end-of-year anonymous survey (Likert scale questions)
  - Current Value: Not systematically measured; anecdotal feedback indicates some residents feel "less comfortable" with behavioral health than other chronic disease management
  - Expected Value: Majority of residents indicating at least "comfortable" with managing common outpatient behavioral health conditions

- Didactic Session Count
  - Source: Didactic schedule (curriculum calendar)
  - Current Value: Behavioral health topics present but not tracked as a group
  - Expected Value: At least several behavioral health-focused sessions during the academic year (exact number to be determined once schedule is finalized)

~~~Team Members:~~~
Program Director, Program Coordinator(s), Associate Program Director(s), Core Faculty Member(s), Behavioral Health Clinician (as available)

~~~Evaluation Mechanisms:~~~
Program-Created Surveys (e.g., satisfaction, program evaluations, etc), Informal faculty feedback from continuity clinic preceptors

~~~Planning Preliminary Work:~~~
- Identify key behavioral health topics to prioritize (e.g., depression, anxiety, ADHD, substance use), Program Director + interested core faculty, Target: November 1, 2025

- Review current didactic calendar to locate available time slots, Program Coordinator(s), Target: December 15, 2025

~~~Iterative Evaluation(s):~~~
- Brief mid-year check-in with residents and faculty to see how the sessions are going and whether any changes to topics or timing are needed, Program Director, February–March 2026

~~~Summative Evaluation(s):~~~
- End-of-Year Resident Survey
  - Include several questions about perceived comfort and adequacy of behavioral health teaching.
  - Review results in APE meeting and decide whether to continue, expand, or modify the behavioral health didactic component.
  Responsible: Program Director, Program Coordinator(s)
  Timeline: June 30, 2026

~~~Action Steps:~~~
- Add behavioral health sessions to the existing didactic calendar covering common topics like depression, anxiety, and ADHD management, Program Director + Program Coordinator(s), January–March 2026

- Reach out to behavioral health clinician(s) and faculty about leading or participating in sessions, Associate Program Director(s), January–April 2026

- Encourage residents to bring questions from recent clinic cases to the sessions, Program Coordinator(s), Ongoing during 2025–2026

- Review resident survey results and faculty feedback at the next APE meeting, Program Director, June–July 2026
