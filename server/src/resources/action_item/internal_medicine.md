Ambulatory Continuity Clinic – Patient Volume and Panel Management

~~~Background:~~~
Residents in the Internal Medicine continuity clinic have expressed that clinic sessions feel "slow" at times and that they do not always feel like they are managing a stable panel of patients. Some residents report seeing many one-time or urgent care visits rather than longitudinal follow-up, and clinic schedules are variable depending on the week and rotation. We have also had informal feedback from a few faculty that residents could benefit from more consistent exposure to chronic disease management (e.g., diabetes, COPD, heart failure) in the ambulatory setting. The program recently transitioned to a new EHR scheduling module which has been an adjustment for staff. At present, we do not have a standardized expectation for the minimum number of patients per half-day clinic or a clear process to track resident panel size over time. We want to improve the overall continuity clinic experience and ensure residents are getting adequate ambulatory exposure.

~~~Objective:~~~
1. Establish a general expectation for average resident patient volume per half-day clinic by the end of the upcoming academic year.
2. Increase resident perception of adequate continuity clinic experience (as measured by annual internal resident survey) compared to the previous year.

~~~Data or Innovation:~~~
We have some baseline data (clinic schedules and anecdotal feedback), but it has not been formally analyzed.

~~~Measurement(s)- Source, Current Value, Expected Value:~~~
Internal resident survey – ambulatory experience item (“I have adequate patient volume and continuity in my clinic”): current value not formally recorded but perceived as low based on comments; expected value is improvement in overall satisfaction on this item by the end of the academic year.

Clinic scheduling reports – approximate average number of patients per resident half-day: baseline not yet calculated; expected value is that most residents will have “adequate” patient volume as determined by the program (number to be determined after initial review).

~~~Team Members:~~~
Program Director, Associate Program Director(s), Chief Resident(s), Clinic Medical Director, Program Coordinator

~~~Evaluation Mechanisms:~~~
Program-Created Surveys (e.g., annual resident survey, mid-year check-in survey), Clinic scheduling reports (resident clinic templates and patient counts)

~~~Planning Preliminary Work:~~~
Review current clinic templates and resident clinic schedules, Clinic Medical Director with Chief Resident(s), October 1, 2025

Collect informal resident feedback about clinic volume and continuity at resident forum, Associate Program Director(s), November 1, 2025

~~~Iterative Evaluation(s):~~~
Brief check-in with Chief Residents and Clinic Medical Director to discuss any noticeable changes in clinic volume or resident concerns, Program Director, Twice per year (January 2026, May 2026)

~~~Summative Evaluation(s):~~~
Compare annual internal resident survey ambulatory experience item year-over-year, Program Director, June 2026

Review average resident patient volume per half-day clinic from scheduling reports, Clinic Medical Director, June 2026

~~~Action Steps:~~~
1. Review current resident clinic templates and identify sessions with consistently low scheduled patient volume; consider modest template adjustments (e.g., adding 1–2 additional appointment slots where feasible), Clinic Medical Director with Program Coordinator, December 1, 2025

2. Provide residents with a brief overview at a noon conference about expectations for continuity clinic, including approximate target patient volume and the importance of follow-up scheduling for continuity, Associate Program Director(s) with Chief Resident(s), January 15, 2026

3. Ask front desk/scheduling staff to prioritize scheduling follow-up appointments with the same resident when possible, particularly for chronic disease management patients, Clinic Medical Director, February 1, 2026

4. Check in with residents mid-year about how clinic is going and make any adjustments to templates or scheduling as needed based on the feedback, Associate Program Director(s) with Clinic Medical Director, March–April 2026
