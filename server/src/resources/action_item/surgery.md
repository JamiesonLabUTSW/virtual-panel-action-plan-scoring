Operative autonomy and progressive responsibility; preparedness for independent practice; senior resident chief experience

~~~Background:~~~
Over the past three academic years, multiple data sources have shown that our residents, particularly graduating chiefs, perceive suboptimal operative autonomy and have variable opportunities for progressive responsibility. The ACGME Resident Survey item on adequate operative experience/autonomy has declined from 72% positive in 2021-2022 to 66% in 2023-2024, now roughly 18 points below the national mean for general surgery (84%). Our internal annual survey shows a parallel trend: the proportion of PGY3-4 residents who agree they have appropriate graded responsibility in the OR dropped from 74% to 65% over three years, and for PGY5s the decline was steeper, from 70% to 58%.

ABSITE operative management subscores for PGY4-5 residents have slipped from the 58th to the 52nd percentile over the same period. While overall ABSITE performance remains acceptable (58th-62nd percentile), the downward trend in operative management domains suggests fewer meaningful intraoperative decision-making opportunities. Case log data tells a similar story: total major cases remain stable and above ABS minimums (950-980 median), but median chief-level cases have drifted from 160 to 148. For key index procedures, laparoscopic colectomy logged as surgeon chief fell from 12 to 9 (ABS national median approximately 14) and complex ventral hernia repair from 7 to 5 (national median approximately 8).

Qualitative feedback from CCC meetings and exit interviews reinforces these numbers. Graduating chiefs describe feeling "well trained but more supervised than necessary" during their final year. Mid-level residents report unclear expectations about when they will be allowed to lead cases. Faculty express uncertainty about how to balance patient safety, efficiency, and graded autonomy given production pressure and increasing case complexity. Despite satisfactory volumes overall, the combination of declining perceived autonomy, fewer chief-level index cases, and falling operative ABSITE subscores indicates we need a more intentional and transparent framework for progressive responsibility.

~~~Objective:~~~
By June 30, 2027, design and implement a structured progressive-responsibility and operative-autonomy curriculum that:
- Improves ACGME survey positive responses on operative experience/autonomy from 66% to 80% or higher.
- Increases internal survey agreement on appropriate graded responsibility from 65% to 80% for PGY3-4 and from 58% to 85% for PGY5.
- Raises median graduating chief-level index cases: laparoscopic colectomy from 9 to 13 or more, complex ventral hernia from 5 to 8 or more, total chief cases from 148 to 165 or more.
- Improves PGY4-5 ABSITE operative management subscores from the 52nd to the 60th percentile or higher by the 2026 exam.

~~~Data or Innovation:~~~
We are building on existing data (ACGME survey, internal surveys, ABSITE, case logs) and implementing a new structured progressive-responsibility framework. This includes standardized PGY-level expectations for index procedures, pre-op autonomy planning and post-op debrief tools, and explicit faculty development on graded autonomy using validated scales like the Zwisch. The autonomy contract and debrief tools are new for our program.

~~~Measurement(s) -- Source, Current Value, Expected Value:~~~
ACGME Resident Survey operative autonomy item: currently 66% positive, target 80% or higher by 2026-2027.
Internal survey appropriate graded responsibility: PGY3-4 currently 65%, target 80%; PGY5 currently 58%, target 85%.
ACGME/ABS case logs for graduating chiefs: total chief cases currently 148 median, target 165 or more; lap colectomy as chief currently 9, target 13; complex ventral hernia as chief currently 5, target 8.
ABSITE PGY4-5 operative/complex management subscores: currently 52nd percentile, target 60th or higher.
Process metrics (new): percent of index cases with documented pre-op autonomy plan and post-op debrief, baseline 0%, target 70% by June 2026 and 85% by June 2027. Percent of core operative faculty completing autonomy faculty development module, baseline 0%, target 90% by December 2025.

~~~Team Members:~~~
Program Director, Associate Program Director for Curriculum, Associate Program Director for Clinical Operations, Site Directors (main hospital and VA), Simulation Director, Chief Residents, Program Coordinator, GME Data Analyst, Department Chair (oversight and alignment with departmental goals)

~~~Evaluation Mechanisms:~~~
ACGME Resident Survey, internal annual resident survey with autonomy items by PGY level, ABSITE scores and subscores, ACGME/ABS case log reports, simulation lab tracking, faculty development completion records, focus groups with PGY3-5 residents, semiannual town halls

~~~Planning Preliminary Work:~~~
We will start by reviewing three years of case log data to identify the top 15-20 index procedures by volume and training importance (e.g., lap cholecystectomy, lap appendectomy, lap colectomy, inguinal hernia, complex ventral hernia, thyroidectomy, mastectomy, trauma laparotomy, emergent bowel resection). The APD for Clinical Operations and GME Data Analyst will lead this by September 2025.

Next we will draft a progressive responsibility framework defining the expected resident role for each index procedure by PGY level, from assistant to partial primary surgeon to primary with direct supervision to primary with distant supervision, incorporating the Zwisch scale. The PD, APD for Curriculum, and Chief Residents will complete a draft by October 2025.

We will then develop standardized tools: a one-page pre-op autonomy contract documenting planned resident role and key learning objectives for that case, and a post-op debrief form with prompts regarding autonomy granted and decision-making during the procedure. The APD for Curriculum and Simulation Director will finalize these by November 2025.

Finally we will design a 45-60 minute faculty development module (live and recorded) covering ACGME/ABS expectations for progressive responsibility, our program's specific data trends, practical use of the Zwisch scale, and strategies for balancing safety and efficiency with trainee autonomy. Content will be finalized by December 2025. We will also incorporate an operative autonomy and expectations session into PGY1 orientation and the annual resident retreat, aligning simulation curriculum to support autonomy milestones. Target for this integration is January 2026.

~~~Iterative Evaluation(s):~~~
We will monitor the percentage of index cases with completed pre-op autonomy plans and post-op debriefs quarterly starting March 2026, along with faculty completion rates for the autonomy module. Results will be discussed at monthly education committee meetings so we can identify and address compliance gaps early.

Semiannually starting July 2026, we will add targeted survey items and conduct PGY3-5 focus groups at each clinical site to assess perceptions of autonomy, identify barriers, and evaluate whether the new tools are being used meaningfully or just checked off.

CCC will review case logs annually in November starting 2026, examining not just total volume but the distribution of surgeon-chief roles in index cases by PGY level. Residents who are under-target will have rotations or case assignments adjusted. ABSITE operative management subscores will be tracked annually after score release in February, with a trigger for focused curriculum review and additional case-based conferences if scores fall below the 55th percentile.

~~~Summative Evaluation(s):~~~
A comprehensive three-year outcome review covering the classes graduating 2026-2028 will compare ACGME survey autonomy items, internal survey results by PGY level, chief case logs (total and index), and ABSITE operative subscores against our 2023-2024 baseline.

Exit interviews will include specific questions on operative autonomy and readiness for independent practice, and a one-year post-graduation alumni survey will track how graduates feel about their operative preparation over time.

Findings will be presented at the October 2027 APE meeting to decide whether the framework becomes standard practice, whether additional interventions such as rotation redesign or case allocation changes are needed, or whether targets should be revised.

~~~Action Steps:~~~
1. Finalize and approve the progressive-responsibility framework by presenting the draft index procedure and PGY-level expectations to the Education Committee and Department Executive Committee for feedback and revision. PD and APD for Curriculum lead; December 2025 through January 2026.

2. Launch faculty development on graded autonomy through at least two live workshops (one per clinical site) plus the recorded module. Require completion for all core operative faculty, strongly encourage it for affiliated faculty, and track completion in MedHub with targeted reminders. PD and Site Directors lead; February-April 2026.

3. Pilot the pre-op autonomy contracts and post-op debrief forms for five high-yield index procedures at main hospital and VA for PGY3-5 residents. Refine based on faculty and resident feedback after a three-month pilot, then expand to the full index procedure list. APD for Clinical Operations and Chief Residents lead; pilot April-June 2026, full rollout July 2026.

4. Integrate autonomy content into conferences and simulation by adding quarterly operative decision-making case conferences for PGY3-5, linked to specific index procedures, and creating simulation scenarios that residents must complete before being assigned as primary surgeon for selected cases like laparoscopic colectomy and complex ventral hernia. Simulation Director and APD for Curriculum lead; curriculum integration by July 2026 with ongoing quarterly sessions.

5. Align rotation structure and individualized goals by reviewing PGY3-5 block assignments to ensure sufficient exposure to index cases in roles consistent with the framework, particularly dedicated blocks on high-volume colorectal and HPB services with explicit chief responsibilities. Starting January 2027, incorporate review of operative autonomy, case logs, and index procedure expectations into each resident's semiannual meeting, setting 2-3 specific autonomy goals. Use ongoing semiannual focus groups and annual anonymous surveys to collect qualitative feedback and share results at town halls and faculty meetings for continuous refinement. APD for Clinical Operations and Site Directors lead; rotation planning October-December 2026, implementation with the 2027-2028 schedule.
