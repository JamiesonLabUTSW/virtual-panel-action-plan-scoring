~~~Background:~~~
Over the past three academic years our pediatric residency has shown plateauing resident scholarly output. Abstract presentations at national or regional meetings have held steady at 6-7 per year, with only 14-17% of residents (5-6 out of 36) presenting any scholarly work. Manuscript output has been similarly flat, averaging one resident first-author publication and 2-3 co-authored papers per year. Only 4 of 36 residents (11%) graduated with a first-author publication over those three years, well below our institutional goal of 25% or more. The APPD LEARN collaborative reports a median of 30-35% of pediatrics residents with at least one presentation by graduation, so we are roughly half the national benchmark.

ACGME Resident Survey scores for "opportunities for scholarly activity" declined from 3.7 to 3.6 over the last two years and now sit 0.5 points below the specialty mean of 4.1, with compliance at 69%. Our internal annual survey shows similar erosion: agreement that residents have access to adequate scholarly mentorship dropped from 63% to 58% over three years, and the proportion who say they understand the steps required to complete a scholarly project fell from 54% to 49%.

Qualitative feedback from CCC meetings, summative evaluations, and the 2023-2024 resident retreat points to several recurring themes. Residents, especially interns, are unsure when and how to start a project. Mentorship is perceived as informal and inconsistent across rotations. Many residents complete QI or advocacy work in continuity clinic or for IHI Open School but never disseminate it beyond the local setting.

Despite having a Division of Pediatric Research, a QI office, and a biostatistics core, we lack a structured longitudinal scholarly activity curriculum with clear milestones or protected time. The current approach relies on ad hoc mentor-mentee matching and an optional research elective that only 4-5 residents per year use. Given ACGME expectations for resident scholarly activity and our goal to graduate pediatricians who can critically appraise evidence and contribute to practice improvement, a more systematic approach is needed.

~~~Objective:~~~
By the end of AY 2026-2027, implement a structured longitudinal scholarly activity program that:
- Increases the proportion of residents with an approved project and identified mentor by end of PGY-2 from 42% (15/36 in 2023-2024) to 80% or higher.
- Increases the proportion of graduating residents with at least one scholarly product (abstract, presentation, or publication at regional/national level) from 17% to 35% or higher for the class of 2027.
- Improves the internal survey item on adequate mentorship from 58% to 80% agree/strongly agree.
- Improves the ACGME survey item on scholarly activity opportunities from 3.6 to 4.0 or higher, within 0.1 points of the specialty mean, by spring 2027.

~~~Data or Innovation:~~~
We are expanding and formalizing existing processes (resident projects, elective time, mentorship) into a structured longitudinal program with new tools including a central project registry, searchable mentor database, standardized templates, and milestone tracking. Some elements are novel for our program but build on existing institutional resources.

~~~Team Members:~~~
Program Director, Associate Program Director for Scholarship, other APDs, Program Coordinators, Chief Residents, Department Vice Chair for Research, QI/Patient Safety Director, Biostatistician (shared departmental resource), Resident Scholarly Activity Liaisons (1-2 per class)

~~~Evaluation Mechanisms:~~~
ACGME Faculty/Resident Surveys, MedHub data (milestones, evaluations, rotation schedules), annual resident scholarly activity survey and post-curriculum evaluations, departmental scholarly activity database tracking abstracts and manuscripts, internal project registry tracking project status and mentor assignments

~~~Planning Preliminary Work:~~~
First, we will conduct a structured review of the last three years of resident scholarly products and categorize them by type, mentor, and venue. From this we will develop a written expectations document outlining minimum requirements by PGY level: project idea by mid-PGY1, IRB/QI approval by mid-PGY2, and dissemination attempt by PGY3. This will be presented to PEC and the Department Education Committee for feedback. The PD, APD for Scholarship, Vice Chair for Research, and Chief Residents will lead this work from August through October 2025.

Second, we will survey pediatric and allied faculty (including subspecialists, hospitalists, and departments like Emergency Medicine and Psychiatry) to identify ongoing projects appropriate for resident involvement and create a searchable mentor and project opportunities database with standardized fields covering project type, timeline, expected resident role, and IRB status. The APD for Scholarship and Vice Chair for Research will lead this from September through December 2025.

Third, we will design a three-year curriculum integrated into Academic Half Day covering project ideation and study design for PGY1s, IRB processes and data collection for PGY2s, and manuscript writing and dissemination for PGY3s. Standardized templates for project proposals, mentor-mentee compacts, and progress tracking will accompany the curriculum. Target completion is January 2026.

Fourth, we will identify and formalize two protected scholarly half-days per ambulatory block per resident starting AY 2026-2027, coordinated with clinic scheduling. We will work with division chiefs and clinic leadership to ensure coverage and set clear expectations that no non-urgent clinical duties occur during protected time. Planning runs November 2025 through March 2026.

~~~Iterative Evaluation(s):~~~
The project registry will be reviewed quarterly at PEC and CCC meetings beginning March 2026 to track what proportion of residents have an identified mentor and approved project. Target trajectory is 50% by June 2026, 65% by December 2026, and 80% by June 2027. Residents who are off-track will receive targeted outreach from the APD for Scholarship and Chief Residents.

Brief electronic evaluations will be collected after each scholarly curriculum session to assess clarity, relevance, and confidence gained, with a target of 80% or more rating sessions as helpful. We will use feedback to refine pacing and content for future sessions.

We will add 4-5 targeted items to the mid-year internal survey assessing clarity of expectations, access to mentors, and confidence in completing a project. Results will be used to adjust mentor assignments and curriculum emphasis, targeting 70% or higher on the mentorship item by spring 2026 and 80% by spring 2027.

Protected time utilization will be tracked via MedHub or calendar logs. A brief quarterly poll will identify barriers such as clinical encroachment or lack of defined tasks. We are targeting 75% utilization of scheduled protected time by December 2026 and 85% by June 2027.

~~~Summative Evaluation(s):~~~
At the end of each academic year we will compile a summary of all resident scholarly products including abstracts, posters, oral presentations, and manuscripts, and compare to baseline. Targets are 25% or more of residents with at least one product in AY 2025-2026 and 35% or more in AY 2026-2027. Findings will be presented to PEC, CCC, and the Department Education Committee.

We will monitor the ACGME survey scholarly activity item annually, targeting 3.8 in 2025-2026 and 4.0 by 2026-2027. We will also track whether graduates report feeling well prepared for scholarly activity via an alumni survey at one year post-graduation, targeting 80% positive responses by the class of 2027.

CCC will formally review each resident's scholarly progress at least annually using milestones (PBLI, SBP) and the project registry, and will document whether each resident has met program-defined scholarly expectations by graduation.

~~~Action Steps:~~~
1. Communicate the new scholarly activity expectations and resources at intern orientation, July housestaff meeting, and department faculty meeting. Distribute a concise resident scholarly activity guide with timelines, templates, and contacts. PD and APD for Scholarship lead; June-July 2025.

2. Conduct an annual fall matching event where faculty briefly present project opportunities and residents submit a one-page project interest form by January, with mentor confirmation by March. APD for Scholarship and Chief Residents lead; starting October 2025 and annually thereafter.

3. Launch the longitudinal curriculum and standardized templates through Academic Half Day, with 3-4 sessions per year per PGY level. Require completion and upload of project proposals and progress tools to MedHub. APD for Scholarship, QI Director, and Biostatistician lead; January-June 2026.

4. Build protected scholarly time into resident schedules for AY 2026-2027 and label it clearly in MedHub/Amion. Provide residents with guidance on planning and documenting use of this time. Chief Residents will monitor for clinical encroachment. PD and Chief Residents lead; schedule build January-April 2026, implementation July 2026.

5. Establish monthly scholarship work-in-progress sessions where residents present ideas or data for feedback from faculty, the QI Director, and the biostatistician. Create a simple request form for biostatistics or QI support with a two-week response target. APD for Scholarship and Biostatistician lead; launch March 2026.

6. Share abstract deadlines for key regional and national meetings annually, allocate departmental funds for resident travel and poster printing (up to $500 per project via micro-grants), and hold an annual resident scholarship day to showcase projects locally. PD and Vice Chair for Research lead; abstract calendar by September 2025, micro-grants by January 2026, first scholarship day May 2026.

7. Review project registry trends, session feedback, and survey data at PEC twice yearly and adjust curriculum, mentor lists, and protected time structure based on findings. Share an annual summary of scholarly activity progress with residents and faculty. PD and APD for Scholarship lead; semi-annually beginning June 2026.
