~~~Background:~~~
Over the past three academic years, multiple data sources have highlighted variability and gaps in direct observation, feedback, and entrustment practices in our Emergency Medicine residency. On the ACGME Resident Survey, the proportion of residents responding "always" or "very often" to "faculty provide appropriate supervision" dropped from 82% in 2022 to 74% in 2024, now 10 points below the national EM mean of 84%. Satisfaction with feedback that helps improve clinical skills fell from 76% to 68% over the same period, against a national mean of 80%.

Our internal program survey (AY 2023-2024, n=42, 86% response rate) found that only 41% of interns, 29% of PGY-2s, and 18% of PGY-3s reported receiving at least one structured documented direct observation per ED block. Just 52% of residents agreed that levels of supervision are clearly communicated and aligned with their competence. Free-text comments described wide variability between attendings in how and when they observe patient care, unclear expectations about what residents can do independently at each PGY level, and feedback that is limited to end-of-shift global comments rather than behavior-based coaching.

CCC milestone data reinforces these concerns. Over the last three cycles (Fall 2022 through Spring 2024), 20-25% of PGY-2 residents showed delayed progression in ICS2 (patient-centered communication) and PROF1 (professional values) despite adequate SLOE comments and strong clinical performance overall. CCC notes frequently cite "limited direct observation documentation" and "insufficient discrete data points" to support entrustment decisions, particularly for high-acuity resuscitations, difficult conversations and disclosure of unanticipated outcomes, and transitions of care.

Review of ED safety events from 2022-2024 identified several near-miss or low-harm incidents where lack of clear supervision expectations or missed real-time observation were contributing factors -- for example, independent disposition of complex chest pain before attending review and delayed escalation in septic shock. While overall serious harm events remain low, the pattern suggests an opportunity to strengthen structured supervision and link it more explicitly to patient safety.

Collectively, these data indicate that our current supervision and feedback model relies too heavily on informal, variable practices rather than a standardized competency-based framework. This contributes to resident uncertainty about expectations and autonomy, faculty inconsistency in direct observation and feedback, CCC challenges in making defensible entrustment decisions, and missed opportunities to connect supervision practices to patient safety outcomes. Given evolving ACGME expectations and the increasing complexity of ED care, a more deliberate and measurable approach is needed.

~~~Objective:~~~
By June 30, 2026, implement a standardized competency-based direct observation and entrustment framework for ED clinical care that:
- Increases the proportion of residents who receive at least two documented structured direct observations per ED block from a baseline of 29% (AY 2023-2024 overall) to 80% or higher.
- Improves ACGME Resident Survey scores for "faculty provide appropriate supervision" from 74% to 85% or higher "always/very often."
- Improves "I receive feedback that helps me improve my clinical skills" from 68% to 80% or higher "satisfied/very satisfied."
- Reduces the proportion of residents flagged by CCC for "insufficient direct observation data for entrustment decisions" from an estimated 22% (average 2022-2024) to 5% or less by Spring 2026.

~~~Data or Innovation:~~~
We are adapting existing tools (structured direct observation forms, entrustment scales, supervision policies) and integrating them into a unified ED-specific framework tailored to our clinical sites and patient population. The combination of scenario-based observation tools with entrustment anchors and explicit linkage to patient safety data is new for our program.

~~~Team Members:~~~
Program Director, Associate Program Directors (Clinical Curriculum and Assessment), Program Coordinators, Core ED Faculty including Site Directors, Chief Residents, Resident Representatives (one per PGY class), CCC Chair, Department Vice Chair for Clinical Operations, ED Nursing Leadership Representative, Institutional Patient Safety/Quality Representative

~~~Evaluation Mechanisms:~~~
ACGME Faculty/Resident Surveys, program-created supervision climate surveys for residents and faculty, MedHub data on number and type of direct observation evaluations and timeliness, CCC documentation of entrustment decisions and narrative comments, duty hour and case mix data to ensure supervision changes do not adversely affect workload, patient safety and quality data including ED incident reports and selected chart reviews for supervision-sensitive events

~~~Planning Preliminary Work:~~~
We will begin by mapping current supervision practices, direct observation tools, and evaluation forms used across all ED sites (main campus, community affiliates, pediatric ED). The PD, APDs, and Program Coordinators will complete this review by May 2025.

Concurrently the APD for Assessment and CCC Chair will review institutional and ACGME requirements related to supervision and milestones and identify external best practices from ACEP, CORD, and ABEM resources, finishing by June 2025.

We will then conduct focus groups with residents by PGY level and with faculty to refine the needs assessment and identify the highest-yield clinical scenarios for structured observation, such as resuscitations, handoffs, informed consent, and procedures. Chief Residents and Resident Representatives will lead this through June 2025.

From those inputs we will develop a draft ED-specific direct observation and entrustment framework covering PGY-level expectations, minimum observation frequency, core scenarios, and use of entrustment scales. The PD, APDs, CCC Chair, and a core faculty workgroup will finalize the draft by August 2025. We will then build and pilot revised MedHub evaluation forms -- brief scenario-based direct observation tools with entrustment anchors -- at one ED site for two months from August through October 2025.

~~~Iterative Evaluation(s):~~~
Monthly monitoring of direct observation completion rates per ED block, per PGY level, and per site will run from October 2025 through June 2026. Program Coordinators and Chief Residents will review these data at monthly leadership meetings and adjust expectations and workflows as needed. Sites or faculty groups falling below 60% of required observations will receive targeted interventions including reminders, one-on-one coaching, and workflow adjustments from the PD and Site Directors.

CCC will review the quality and utility of direct observation data for entrustment decisions quarterly (November 2025, February 2026, May 2026), sampling narrative comments and assessing whether the new data points are improving the committee's ability to make defensible milestone and entrustment decisions.

A semiannual resident and faculty supervision climate survey in December 2025 and June 2026 will assess perceived clarity of supervision expectations, quality of feedback received, and documentation burden. We will compare results to our baseline internal survey data and use findings to make mid-course adjustments to the framework, faculty development content, and observation workflows.

~~~Summative Evaluation(s):~~~
By June 30, 2026 we will conduct a comprehensive review of direct observation completion rates (per block, PGY level, and site), ACGME Resident Survey supervision and feedback items, CCC entrustment documentation and milestone trends, and selected patient safety indicators for supervision-sensitive events to determine whether objectives were met.

The PD and APD for Assessment will present outcomes and lessons learned at the departmental faculty meeting and PEC by August 2026, with findings incorporated into the next APE cycle and long-term supervision policy. This will determine whether the framework is adopted as standard practice, scaled to additional sites, or modified based on the data.

~~~Action Steps:~~~
1. Finalize PGY-specific entrustable activities and supervision levels by completing a concise list of ED-relevant EPAs (e.g., manage undifferentiated chest pain, lead initial resuscitation of septic shock, perform procedural sedation, conduct high-risk ED discharge) with PGY-specific supervision expectations aligned to ACGME EM Milestones and ABEM content areas. PD and APD for Clinical Curriculum lead; by August 2025.

2. Develop and implement standardized direct observation tools in MedHub: brief scenario-based forms (2-3 minutes to complete) with behaviorally anchored checklists covering medical decision-making, communication, professionalism, and team leadership, plus a 5-point entrustment scale from "requires direct supervision" to "may supervise others." Include versions for resuscitations, procedures, difficult conversations, handoffs, and general encounters. APD for Assessment and Program Coordinators lead; by October 2025.

3. Set minimum observation requirements of at least two documented direct observations per resident per ED block, including at least one high-acuity or resuscitation observation for PGY-2 and PGY-3 and at least one communication-focused observation (e.g., discharge counseling, breaking bad news) per month for all PGY levels. Embed these expectations into orientation materials for new residents and faculty, ED shift templates with designated observation windows, and chief resident scheduling and shift assignment practices. Develop a simple resident-facing dashboard or monthly email summary showing each resident's observation count versus expectations. PD and Chief Residents lead; by November 2025.

4. Conduct faculty development on observation, feedback, and entrustment through at least two dedicated workshops for core and community ED faculty covering efficient real-time observation during busy shifts, delivering specific behavior-based feedback, and applying entrustment scales consistently. Provide brief tip sheets and short videos as just-in-time resources and integrate into new faculty onboarding. Track attendance and module completion. PD lead; initial workshops by December 2025, ongoing thereafter.

5. Integrate observation data into CCC and milestone reviews by modifying CCC pre-meeting reports to include the number and type of direct observations per resident, entrustment ratings, and narrative comments linked to specific EPAs. Train CCC members to use these data explicitly when assigning milestone levels. CCC Chair and APD for Assessment lead; by January 2026.

6. Monitor impact on supervision-sensitive patient safety events by collaborating with the institutional patient safety office to define a set of supervision-sensitive ED event types (escalation delays, unreviewed high-risk discharges, procedural complications) and conduct semiannual chart reviews of a sample of events to assess whether supervision and observation practices contributed. Use findings to refine supervision expectations and inform faculty development. PD, Patient Safety Representative, and ED Nursing Leadership lead; first review by March 2026, second by June 2026.

7. Review monthly observation completion reports at chief and leadership meetings and share de-identified site-level dashboards with faculty to maintain transparency. Use the semiannual climate surveys and ongoing data review to continuously refine the framework, adjust observation workflows, and ensure the program is meeting its targets without creating unsustainable documentation burden. PD and Chief Residents lead; ongoing from October 2025 through June 2026.
